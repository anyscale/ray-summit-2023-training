    "# 1. Fine-Tune ViT for Image Classification with Hugging Face\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Milestone 1: Using Plain Hugging Face Transformers**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this kick-off notebook, we're jumping straight into one of the most active areas of deep learning: transformers. You've likely heard of using transformers for natural language tasks, but there's also been great strides in using this architecture for audio, visual, and other multimodal applications. Today we'll be fine-tuning Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification using Hugging Face, without Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, this isn't just a one-and-done exercise! This initial example serves as the foundation for our subsequent notebooks, where we'll gently weave in the capabilities of Ray Train, Ray Data, and Ray Serve for scalable machine learning. So, let's get familiar with the base logic here so that we can hit the ground running in the next notebook.\n",

    "The Vision Transformer, or ViT for short, was introduced in a groundbreaking paper by researchers at Google Brain in [June 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929). This innovation explores the concept of tokenizing images, similar to how we tokenize sentences in NLP, enabling us to leverage transformer models for image-related tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ViT Architecture](https://huggingface.co/blog/assets/51_fine_tune_vit/vit-figure.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be summarized in three major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Tokenization**: Images are divided into a grid of sub-image patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linear Projection**: Each patch is embedded using a linear projection, effectively converting visual content into numerical representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tokenized Sequence**: These embedded patches are treated as tokens, forming a sequence that can be processed by transformer models."
