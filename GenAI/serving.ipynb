    "## 1. Introduction to Ray Serve\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) is a framework for serving machine learning systems. With features like autoscaling, services composition, and response streaming, it offers efficient, high-performance serving for Large Language Model and Generative AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built on top of Ray, it abstracts away the infrastructure complexities while inheriting the performance capabilities of the core distributed runtime. As a Ray AI Library, Serve extends the workflow from Ray Data, Train, and Tune to provide a cohesive end-to-end development to production experience. \n",

    "|Ray Serve can independently scale replicas, deployments, and nodes allowing for flexible and dynamic adjustment to incoming request load.|\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deployment**: A deployment is the fundamental user-facing unit in Ray Serve. Within a deployment are a number of replicas, which are copies of a class or function started in separate Ray Actors, and during runtime, these replicas can be autoscaled to match request traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. **Ingress Deployment (HTTP Handling)**: The ingress deployment serves as the entry point for all traffic. It defines the HTTP handling logic for the application, with the `__call__` method of the class handling incoming requests. Serve also integrates with FastAPI for expressive API definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **ServeHandle (Composing Deployments)**: A ServeHandle is a bound deployment and allows multiple independent deployments to call into each other. In this way, it facilitates flexible and complex model composition where bound deployments can reference other bound deployments. At runtime, these references become ServeHandles for querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Application**: An application is composed of one or more deployments and can be accessed via HTTP routes or Python handles."
