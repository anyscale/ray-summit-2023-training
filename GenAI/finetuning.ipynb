    "# Dreambooth: Few Shot Fine-Tuning for Personalized Stable Diffusion\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll leverage Ray's capabilities to efficiently distribute the fine-tuning and inference processes for a text-to-image generation model. This strategy draws inspiration from the pioneering work of [Dreambooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242), which introduced a methodology to tailor diffusion models according to individual subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the conclusion of this guide, you'll not only possess a finely tuned model with the ability to portray a distinctive dog within a diverse array of scenarios, but you'll also cultivate a more profound comprehension of harnessing Ray for scaling up training and inference tasks across numerous computational nodes.\n",
