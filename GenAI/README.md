## Overview

Text-to-image models (like Stable Diffusion) have revolutionized the landscape of AI-based applications by introducing the ability to synthesize incredibly realistic and coherent images. However, using these models is difficult due to a number of challenges including:

- Compute requirements, including mix of CPU and GPU instances,\
- The need to stitch together fine-tuning with inference and model deployment for more end-to-end MLOps experience,\
- The requirement for a capable infrastructure to successfully deploy these models.

This hands-on training aims to address these challenges and demonstrate, in a practical manner, how to fine-tune stable diffusion models, execute batch inference to generate additional images, and ultimately deploy the model within a production-ready environment.

## Learning Outcomes

-   Use Ray, Anyscale and HuggingFace to operationalize stable diffusion models.
-   Identify challenges and trade-offs when working with GenAI at scale.
-   Scale all components of the workload: fine-tuning, batch inference and model serving.
-   Extend the experience to your own specific context, applications, stack and scale.
